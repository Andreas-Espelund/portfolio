                My name is Andreas, i'm 23 years old and currently doing my masters in informatics at UiO.
                I would describe myself as a (aspiring) full stack developer, with a passion for back-end and low level stuff like networks and distributed systems.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl">
                I'm also a guitarist, and as a result i also like to explore electronics and analogue technology.
                At the moment my favorite programming language is Go, but i'm always looking to learn new stuff.
